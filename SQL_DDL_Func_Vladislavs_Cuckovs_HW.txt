1.What operations do the following functions perform: film_in_stock, film_not_in_stock, inventory_in_stock, get_customer_balance, inventory_held_by_customer, rewards_report, last_day? You can find these functions in dvd_rental database.
film_in_stock - show film that are available in the specific inventory 
film_not_in_stock - show film that are not available in the specific inventory  
inventory_in_stock - return true if no rentals and false otherwise
get_customer_balance - CALCULATE THE CURRENT BALANCE GIVEN A CUSTOMER_ID AND A DATE
inventory_held_by_customer - inventory that was not rented by customer
rewards_report -  Find all customers meeting the monthly purchase requirements
last_day - return last day of the month

2.Why does ‘rewards_report’ function return 0 rows? Correct and recreate the function, so that it's able to return rows properly.
There is reward report by last month, but it takes 3 lash months values and also it takes current_date
3.Is there any function that can potentially be removed from the dvd_rental codebase? If so, which one and why?
last_day, beacause there is build in function date_trunc()
4.* The ‘get_customer_balance’ function describes the business requirements for calculating the client balance. 
Unfortunately, not all of them are implemented in this function. Try to change function using the requirements from the comments.
 In the script file
5.* How do ‘group_concat’ and ‘_group_concat’ functions work? (database creation script might help) Where are they used?
‘_group_concat’ combine to string with a comma, but ‘group_concat’ allow to apply ‘_group_concat’ fucntion repeatedly and could be used in GROUP BY clause. 
6.* What does ‘last_updated’ function do? Where is it used?
 return last day of the month.
7.* What is tmpSQL variable for in ‘rewards_report’ function? Can this function be recreated without EXECUTE statement and dynamic SQL? Why?
 It is used to build a dynamic SQL sring. Yes it can be written without dynamic SQL that improve speed and more readable.
